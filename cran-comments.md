## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* used the lower case for non-specific names in Description
* used single quotes around the package name 'TMB' in Description
* removed "Internal function" descriptions in exported functions
* included small executable examples for all exported functions 
* further simplified example data

## Test environments
* local OS X install (10.14.3), R 3.5.3
* ubuntu 16.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2, R-devel
* windows server 2008 R2 SP1 R-release (rhub), R-devel 32/64 bit
* win-builder release, R-devel
