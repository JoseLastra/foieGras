## Submission
This update adds a number of new features and addresses errors listed under CRAN check results (01/06/2020) on version 0.4.0. I am unable to test on a number of R-hub platforms due to sf source build issues.

## Test environments
* local OS X install (10.15.5), R 4.0.0
* ubuntu 16.04.6 (via travis-ci), r-release, r-devel, r-oldrelease
* Debian clang (via R-hub), r-devel
* windows (via win-builder), r-release, r-devel

## R CMD check results
