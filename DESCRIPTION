Description: Fits continuous-time random walk and correlated random walk state-space models to filter Argos satellite location data. Template Model Builder ('TMB') is used for fast estimation. The Argos data can be: (older) least squares-based locations; (newer) Kalman filter-based locations with error ellipse information; or a mixture of both. Separate measurement models are used for these two data types. The models estimate two sets of location states corresponding to: 1) each observation, which are (usually) irregularly timed; and 2) user-specified time intervals (regular or irregular).
