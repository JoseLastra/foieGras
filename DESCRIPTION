Description: `foieGras` is an R package that fits a continuous-time state-space model (either a simple Randon Walk or a Correlated Random Walk) to filter Argos satellite location data. Template Model Builder (`TMB`) is used for fast estimation. The Argos data can be: (older) Least Squares-based locations; (newer) Kalman Filter-based locations with error ellipse information; or a mixture of both. Separate measurement models are used for these two data types. The model estimates two sets of location states corresponding to: 1) each observation, which are (usually) irregularly timed; and 2) user-specified time intervals (regular or irregular).
