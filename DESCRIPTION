Description: Fits continuous-time Random Walk and Correlated Random Walk state-space models to filter Argos satellite location data. Template Model Builder (`TMB`) is used for fast estimation. The Argos data can be: (older) Least Squares-based locations; (newer) Kalman Filter-based locations with error ellipse information; or a mixture of both. Separate measurement models are used for these two data types. The models estimate two sets of location states corresponding to: 1) each observation, which are (usually) irregularly timed; and 2) user-specified time intervals (regular or irregular). See Jonsen et al. (2019) Ecology 100:e02566 <doi:10.1002/ecy.2566>.
